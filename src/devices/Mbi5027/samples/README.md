# MBI5027 -- 16-Bit shift register driver app

This [test application](Program.cs) tests the [MBI5027 binding](../README.md).

It supports GPIO and SPI. It supports daisy chaining. The test app supports up to 2 shift registers (up to 32-bits). It would be easy to extend to a support more shift registers.
